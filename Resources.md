# Resources

List of resources for finding tools, looking up information about topic
specific things that are generally common during CTF challenges. There is
a lot more on the internet. Being honest, first link that should be here
is your preferred search engine. If you know how to search, find writeups,
find information and learn about new things fast you are good to go. To
the moon obviously!
